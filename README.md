# Warehouse Robot Project
Robotics project to develop a robot that maps out the optimal path to boxes and delivers them in a specific order to a specific area while avoiding obstacles. The robot uses A* planning to develop the most efficient path. The warehouse in Part A is represented as a discrete grid, while Part B is a continuous world. These programs were able to achieve 97% efficiency in path planning. More detailed problem statements can be found at the top of each file.
